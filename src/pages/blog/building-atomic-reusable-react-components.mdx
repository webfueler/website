# Building atomic reusable React components
If you ever worked on big React projects, you certaintly had to write smaller components to be reused by bigger ones.
In this case I am calling these components `atoms`. If you want to know more about Atomic Design, you can check
this page by Brad Frost which explains it very well: [https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

## Writting a simple input element
The basic principles for writting scalable components are the following

### 1. Localize your styles
In the example posted bellow, I have used [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) that provide local scoping by default.
Another way to localize styles, is to use CSS scoping and good methodologies like [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) and [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) to avoid
selector specificity and make your CSS scalable.

Example:
```scss
.card {
  &__header { ... }
  &__body { ... }
  &__footer { ... }

  .is-active { ... }
}
```

### 2. All data should be passed through props
Reusable atomic components should not be responsible for any data manipulation / fetching / state.
The state should be only used for UI / UX.
This will minimize the component dependencies and make it testable with simple assertions.

### 3. Props should extend native HTML element props
Make sure you extend the root element native props, so that we don't restrict consumers from using whatever props they need (unless it's a requirement).
In this example, I am moving the `className` to the wrapper element so that consumers can have more flexibility if they need to overwrite styles (they shouldn't, but ok...).
The remaining props are passed to the native element.

```tsx
type InputProps = {
  iconUrl?: string;
} & React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>;

const Input = ({ iconUrl, className, ...nativeProps }: InputProps) => {
  const rootElementClassname = "input";
  const classes = {
    root: cn(
      styles[rootElementClassname],
      {
        [styles["has-icon"]]: iconUrl
      },
      className
    ),
    icon: styles[`${rootElementClassname}__icon`],
    nativeElement: styles[`${rootElementClassname}__native-element`]
  };

  return (
    <div className={classes.root}>
      {iconUrl && <img src={iconUrl} alt="icon" className={classes.icon} />}
      <input {...nativeProps} className={classes.nativeElement} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
