# Building atomic reusable React components
If you ever worked on big React projects, you certaintly had to write smaller components to be reused by bigger ones.
In this case I am calling these components `atoms`. If you want to know more about Atomic Design, you can check
this page by Brad Frost which explains it very well: [https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

## Writting a simple input
The basic principles for writting scalable components are the following:
- localize your styles (in this example we are using CSS modules, but scoping is another option)
- make sure you extend the root element native props, so that we don't restrict consumers from using whatever props they need (unless it's a requirement).
In this example, I am moving the `className` to the wrapper element so that consumers can have more flexibility if they need to overwrite styles (they shouldn't, but ok...).
The remaining props are passed to the native element.

```tsx
type InputProps = {
  iconUrl?: string;
} & React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>;

const Input = ({ iconUrl, className, ...nativeProps }: InputProps) => {
  const rootElementClassname = "input";
  const classes = {
    root: cn(
      styles[rootElementClassname],
      {
        [styles["has-icon"]]: iconUrl
      },
      className
    ),
    icon: styles[`${rootElementClassname}__icon`],
    nativeElement: styles[`${rootElementClassname}__native-element`]
  };

  return (
    <div className={classes.root}>
      {iconUrl && <img src={iconUrl} alt="icon" className={classes.icon} />}
      <input {...nativeProps} className={classes.nativeElement} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
