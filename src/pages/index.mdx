# Joao Santos

I'm a web developer, passionate by innovation and user experience. I have been working in web development since 2005, but last years I have been focused in **front-end development**.

Currently my favourite tech stack is **React with TypeScript**, making use of **MobX** and **InversifyJS** to achieve better abstractions on bigger projects.

For CI / CD I usually use **Jenkins** and have build a number of CI flows to help our teams to deliver code, both in backend and frontend projects.

Learning new technologies is something that I love to do, so I am always happy to research and experiment with new ones, mainly in the **Javascript** world 😍

On my free time I swim, I [play the guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpinZPqXYhc&list=PLsiS4dN8ap2_2N27tJkPMfv4-0uDTvcco&index=1), I repair and drive my old cars, I hang out with my family and I take some pictures.
